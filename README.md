## 🚀 About Me

😀 A bit about myself, I'am Guillaume CARRA, a **Front End Junior Web Developer**. After having various trades and having been a Salesman of Collective Sports for 3 years, I wanted to reconvert myself in Web Development.<br>
🎓 For this I followed a **Fullstack JavaScript Developer Training**, delivering the Professional Title **"Web and Mobile Web Developer"**, in telepresential, within the O'clock school.

🧠 Currently I continue to work in a self-taught way, I continue to learn with the documentation and the resources that can be found on the internet ReactJS, Javascript and soon TailwindCSS and NextJS.

✨ Outside the world of tech, my hobbies range from **playing or watching soccer** ⚽, **runing** 🏃‍♂️, **playing video games** 🎮, **watching series** 📺 and **reading books** 📚.
